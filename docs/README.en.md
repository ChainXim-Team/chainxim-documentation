# ChainXim User Guide

## Introduction
ChainXim is a blockchain simulator developed by XinLab to simulate and verify blockchain systems under different parameter settings. We hope that ChainXim can be compatible with different consensus protocols, network models, and can design different attackers to comprehensively evaluate the blockchain's security, throughput, and other performance metrics.

### Configuration Environment
1. Install Anaconda. [Anaconda download link](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Open Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu.
3. Create a conda environment and activate it, choosing Python version 3.10.
```
conda create -n chainxim python=3.10 python-graphviz
activate chainxim
```
4. Install the required packages via pip.
```
cd <project_directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Simple Startup
1. Open Anaconda Prompt from the Start menu, and activate the conda environment before running.
```
activate chainxim
```
2. Run the main program in the ChainXim root directory.
```
cd <project_directory>
python main.py
```

## Test Examples
Pass the following parameters to the main program, which will make ChainXim randomly generate a miner network with 10 nodes, 2 of which are attackers, using the TopologyNetwork model, and the simulation will last for 3000 rounds.
```
python main.py --total_round 3000 --miner_num 10 -t 2 --network_type network.TopologyNetwork --no_compact_outputfile --save_routing_graph --show_label
```
After the simulation starts, it will output the simulation parameters and display a progress bar during the simulation.
```

![simulation-result](doc/simulation-result.png)

In addition, various data generated during the simulation will be saved in the Results folder, including each miner's blockchain records, blockchain visualization graphics, blockchain attacker logs, routing history, network topology, block propagation diagrams, etc. Note that if the command line parameters `--no_compact_outputfile --save_routing_graph` are missing, some files may not be output.

Blockchain visualization diagram ([blockchain visualisation.svg](doc/blockchain-visualisation.svg))

![blockchain-visualisation](doc/blockchain-visualisation.svg)

Each point in the figure represents a block, with blue points representing blocks generated by honest miners and red points representing blocks generated by attackers. The x-coordinate of each point represents the round in which the block was generated, and the y-coordinate represents the height of the block. **Note: If too many rounds are run, resulting in too many blocks, the generated image may become crowded and difficult to distinguish.**

Network topology diagram ([Network Results/network topology.svg](doc/network-topology.svg))

![network-topology](doc/network-topology.svg)

The transmission bandwidth between adjacent nodes is marked in the figure, with the unit being MB/round.

-----
Block propagation diagram (taking block B2 as an example: [Network Results/routing_graphB2.svg](doc/routing-graphB2.svg))

![routing-graphB2](doc/routing-graphB2.svg)

The above figure shows the entire process of block B2 propagating from node 6 to the entire network. Each solid arrow in the figure is marked with two pairs of positive numbers. The first pair identifies the source miner and target miner IDs of a certain propagation process, and the second pair identifies the start and end rounds of a certain propagation process.

## Simulator Input Parameters
The input parameters of the simulator can be specified in two ways: command line and configuration file. Generally, you can modify the configuration file system_config.ini that comes with ChainXim to change the simulation parameters, or you can specify individual simulation parameters through the command line. The command line supports fewer parameters than the configuration file, but once specified, they take precedence over the configuration file. You can view the command line help information by using the command `python main.py --help`.

In the figure, Common Prefix[0], [1], [2] represent the first three components of the common prefix PDF, where the ordinal number represents the difference between the common prefix and the main chain length (see the "Simulator Output" section for details).
### Common Prefix Property of Blockchain under Topology Network

- Rounds: 16189
- Number of miners: 10
- Consensus type: PoW
- Difficulty: 000FFF...
- Network type: TopologyNetwork
- Network parameters: gen_net_approach=adj; bandwidth_honest=0.5

At the end of each round, the height difference of the local chains of all nodes relative to the common prefix and its impact on the Common Prefix PDF are shown in the figure below. The time axis below is the round in which the chain tail switch event occurred, the upper x-axis is the block height/common prefix followed by the block length (suffix length), and the y-axis is the miner ID. The heat value in the figure indicates the cumulative number of times each miner's local chain tail reaches the suffix length relative to the common prefix. BXX in the figure refers to the block number, representing the state of the miner's local chain tail in the current round, and the lower x-axis indicates the height of these blocks. Click Play to start the animation, where you can observe the block being generated to extend the common prefix, then propagating to other miners, and finally causing the common prefix height to increase by 1.

##### **Impact of Different Miner Chain Selection Strategies on Selfish Mining Attack**

![selfish_mining_2](doc/selfish_mining_2.png){: style="height: 460px"}

The theoretical region in the figure is obtained by the following formula:

$$ R=\frac{\alpha(1-\alpha)^{2}(4\alpha+\gamma(1-2\alpha))-\alpha^{3}}{1-\alpha(1+(2-\alpha)\alpha)} $$

$\alpha$ is the proportion of the attacker's hash power to the total network, $0\leqslant\alpha\leqslant\frac{1}{2}$.
$\gamma$ is the proportion of honest miners who choose to mine on the attack chain when there is a fork between the honest chain (the latest block is produced by an honest node) and the attack chain (all blocks from a certain block to the latest block are produced by the attacker), $0\leqslant\gamma\leqslant1$.
Note: The chain selection strategy is an internal test functionality and is not yet available. However, this simulator follows the mining strategy of $\gamma=0$, which means all honest nodes default to continue mining on the honest chain branch. Therefore, users can use the following theoretical curve formula for verification.

$$ R=\frac{4\alpha^{2}(1-\alpha)^{2}-\alpha^{3}}{1-\alpha(1+(2-\alpha)\alpha)} $$

**Parameter settings:**

* Simulation rounds: 100000 rounds * 20 times

* Number of miners: 40

* Consensus type: PoW

* Difficulty: 000FFF...

* q_ave = 1

* Network type: SynchronousNetwork

#### 3. Double Spending Attack

##### **Impact of Different Networks on Double Spending Attack**

![doublespending](doc/doublespending.png){: style="height: 460px"}

**Parameter settings:**

* Simulation rounds: 1200000 rounds * 1 time

* Number of miners: 40

* Consensus type: PoW

* Difficulty: 000FFF...

* q_ave = 1

* Network parameters: default for all four network types

##### **Impact of Different Strategies on Double Spending Attack and Theoretical Comparison**

![double_spending](doc/double_spending.png){: style="height: 460px"}

The theoretical curve in the figure is obtained by the following formula:

$$P(N,N_g,\beta)=1-\sum_{n=0}^{N}\begin{pmatrix}n+N-1\\
n
\end{pmatrix}\left(\frac{1}{1+\beta}\right)^{N}\left(\frac{\beta}{1+\beta}\right)^{n}\left(\frac{1-\beta^{N-n+1}}{1-\beta^{Ng+1}}\right)$$

$N$ is the number of blocks the attacker waits for confirmation, i.e., the attacker will wait for the honest chain to grow by $N$ blocks before deciding whether to publish.
$N_g$ indicates that the attacker abandons the current attack when it is $N_g$ blocks behind the honest chain.
$\beta$ is the ratio of the attacker's hash power to that of the honest miners, $0\leqslant\beta\leqslant1$.

**Parameter settings:**

* Simulation rounds: 3000000 rounds * 1 time

* Number of miners: 40

* Consensus type: PoW

* Difficulty: 000FFF...

* q_ave = 1

* Network type: SynchronousNetwork

#### 4. Eclipse Attack

##### **Double Spending Attack under Eclipse Attack**

![eclipse1](doc/eclipse1.png){: style="height: 460px"}

The green curve Theory Shift 10% is obtained by shifting the Theory curve to the left by one unit.

![eclipse2](doc/eclipse2.png){: style="height: 460px"}

**Parameter settings:**

* Simulation rounds: 3000000 rounds * 1 time

* Number of miners: 20

* Consensus type: PoW

* Difficulty: 000FFF...

* q_ave = 1

* Network type: TopologyNetwork

* Network parameters: The Full connect topology, Random connect topology, Eclipse 10% miners, and Eclipse 20% miners in the figure use fixed adjacency matrices to generate the topology network. Their adjacency matrices are $TP_F$, $TP_R$, $TP_1$, and $TP_2$, respectively, and other settings are default.
    - The $TP_F$ matrix has all elements as 1 except for the diagonal elements which are 0.
    - The $TP_R$ matrix is a randomly generated topology network.
    - The $TP_1$ matrix is as shown below (isolated nodes are 18, 19):
        ![matrix_tp1](doc/matrix_tp1.png)
    - The $TP_2$ matrix is as shown below (isolated nodes are 16, 17, 18, 19):
        ![matrix_tp2](doc/matrix_tp2.png)
        

**Note: When setting attackers, please avoid isolated nodes and set them manually.**
